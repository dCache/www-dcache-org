Once a year dCache developers, sysadmins and friends from around the world meet to exchange news, best practices and gossip. In the past those meetings were held in beautiful cities around the world such as Amsterdam, Madrid, Taipei, Hamburg and many more. Due to the current situation, this year's meeting was held as a video conference on the 26th/27th of May in the afternoon hours.
