We are happy to announce the 19th International dCache workshop 2025 will
take place from 2025-05-20 to 2025-05-21 in person and hosted by CC-IN2P3 in Lyon.

https://indico.desy.de/e/dcache-uw19

As usual we will present forthcoming developments and technologies,
both provided by and influencing dCache. However, we are always happy to
include presentations from you, especially if you have a special configuration,
user community or use case, or experience with new hardware. If you have something to share with us or have an interest
in a particular topic - hands up!

Please contact us for workshop related questions and suggestion using   `workshop‘πdcache.org`.
