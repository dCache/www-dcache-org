After almost two decades, dCache.org web content has been migrated from regular
html pages written by hand to a modern static site generator based on [hugo](https://gohugo.io).

This change will simplify the maintenance of the web pages and will allow developers to keep
the content up-to-date. The new pages and documentation can be added just by dropping a file written in markdown format into desired directory. The source code of the pages is available on the [github](https://github.com/dCache/www-dcache-org.git) and can be directly edited in a browser.

The new pages a following `Responsive design` concept, which makes them mobile device friendly.
