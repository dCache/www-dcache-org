We get contacted by EGI security to comment on PostgreSQL vulnerability
[CVE-2022-1552](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2022-1552/).

The dCache itself is not affected. Moreover, the most of the installations do not
share postgresql used by dCache with other services, thus there are no other users
'having permission to create non-temp objects' on the same DB.

Nonetheless, we encourage sites to update the postgresql servers to recommended
versions `at the next possible maintenance slot`.
