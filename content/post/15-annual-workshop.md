We are happy to announce the 15th International dCache Virtual Workshop.

https://indico.desy.de/event/29564/

As usual we will present forthcoming developments and technologies,
both provided by and influencing dCache. However, we are always happy to
include presentations from you, especially if you have a special configuration,
user community or use case, or experience with new hardware. If you have something to share with us or have an interest
in a particular topic - hands up!


We have reserved two slots: one  Jun 1 from 16:00 to 17:30 CEST (9:00 - 10:30 AM CST)
for the dCache project report and a second one, Jun 2 from 16:00 to 17:30 CEST (9:00- 10:30 AM CST) for sites.

Please contact us for workshop related questions and suggestion using   `workshop‘πdcache.org`.
