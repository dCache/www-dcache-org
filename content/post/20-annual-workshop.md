We are pleased to announce the 20th International dCache Workshop 2025!
The workshop will be held in person from May 6 to May 7, 2026, at Nikhef in Amsterdam.

As always, we will present upcoming developments and technologies related to dCache,
as well as those influencing its ecosystem. We also welcome contributions from the
community—whether you have a unique configuration, a specific user community use case,
or experience with new hardware, we'd love to hear from you!

If you have something to share or are interested in a particular topic, let us know—your input is invaluable!

Please contact us for workshop-related questions and suggestions using `workshopԹdcache.org`.
