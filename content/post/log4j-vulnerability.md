A critical security vulnerability [CVE-2021-44228][1] has been identified in the popular "Apache Log4j 2" library (2.x <= 2.15.0-rc1). This has raised concerns among many dCache admins, who have contacted us either directly or by sending a message to `securityÔ¹dcache.org`. Thanks for that!

## Log4j in dCache

dCache uses `logback` as the default logging solution and does not distribute the Log4j library with officially released packages. It is therefore **not affected**.

## Log4j in ZooKeeper and Kafka

Like many Java based projects, ZooKeeper and Apache Kafka use Log4j as their logging library. However, they both depend on `log4j-1.2.x`, which is not
vulnerable to this CVE.

## Log4j in the dCache project infrastructure

We are currently checking the entire dCache project infrastructure for the presence of vulnerable versions of the Log4j library. This work is ongoing.
