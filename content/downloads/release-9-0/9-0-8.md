### bulk

`RuntimeException`s should not cause the `request ls` to fail globally.

### other

Update our citations file.

### pnfs

A modest speed-up of directory listing by not always
resolving symlinks when checking restrictions.

### qos

Two small incompatibilities with subject and attributes are fixed.

Improvements in triggering QoS operation queues, which reduces the
potential for queue starvation.
