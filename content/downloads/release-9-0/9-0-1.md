### frontend


Better error message reporting.


The RESTful interface supports
paths relative to the user root
as well as absolute paths for requests
to the bulk service.

Note: a separate solution will be necessary
for the one-off `namespace` resource operations.

### kafka

Ensure, that exception is converted to a string. Better logging.

### migration


When broken files were discovered during migration the migration module was going into sleeping state.
This is now fixed.

### pnfsmanger


The current release fixed migration move/copy going into SLEEP mode when the file on the pool has been deleted.

### pool

Now the reduce possibility of stacked movers in `CANCELED` state is ensured.


### webdav

The observed NPE should disappear.


### xrootd4j


update to next xrootd4j version (4.5.6, 4.4.7, 4.3.8, 4.2.12)
