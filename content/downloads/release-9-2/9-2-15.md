### bulk


Some of the format strings that manage the formatting of command results were sending to the user expect a different 
number of parameters than provided.
This is now fixed and the returned bulk info strings return all expected values.

### info


DGAs send messages to other dCache cells to discover their current status. These messages have a hard-coded one second timeout.

Some queries are data-intensive and could take longer than one second to build the answer, resulting in no information being provided.

this is now fixed and the info service will now wait longer for a cell to respond to a query for information.

### nfs


Grizzly memory management uses heap memory size fraction even if direct memory is used (issue 7529).
This issue has been fixed and  dCache starts with 256m of direct memory.
