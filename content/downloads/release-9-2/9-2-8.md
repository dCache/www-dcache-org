### chimera

A recent commit as a side effect resulted in failure to upload a file to an xroot door with the overwrite ("-f") option, returning okay but removing the original file without creating the new one. This patch reverts the offending commit: copy with an overwrite flag works again.

### CI

Improve build pipeline.

### gplazma

Previously, a missing banfile would result in every successive login attempt failing with an NPE. Now, even if configured, an empty or inexistent banfile will be ignored and logins should succeed.
WARNING: This changes the banfile plugin behaviour! Empty and non-existent banfiles will be treated the same.

### system-test

Increases the small default direct memory value for system-test: NFS on system-test works again.

### webdav

Update webdav door to retry the request to the namespace if checksum is not present in files attributes.

### xroot

A recent commit introduced handling of relative paths in xrootd with inadvertent side effect of dropping support xroot.root variable. This patch reverts that commit: pre-9.2 behavior is restored.
