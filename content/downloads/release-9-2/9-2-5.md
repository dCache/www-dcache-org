### bulk

The current releae  fixed handling of uncaught exception.

### dcache-view

dCache-view has been updated to 2.1.0 
and it includes modifications to use new RolePrincipal
instead of the roles plugin role, eliminating
the need for additional logins for admin privileges.

### qos


With ingest queues servicing large
numbers of requests, as we have
for performance reasons configured as
defaults on QoS and Bulk, there was a
potential for a race between the
processing of the original modify
request and a subsequent cancellation
request, such that cancellation
could  not find the request as it
was still in the executor queue.

This is fixed now and are is a trailing stream
of requests still being processed
after cancellation (from Bulk)
completes.
