### webdav


A recent path introduced support for adding the Link HTTP response header, according to RFC 6249. Unfortunately, the code added the Link header for all requests, not just the intended GET and HEAD requests.

Additionally, due to peculiarities of how Milton generates PROPFIND results, the Link header is added multiple times: once for each subdirectory.

This results in the HTTP response headers taking up too much space and dCache failing the request, returning a 500 status code.


This  regression has been now fixed where PROPFIND requests would fail if the directory contains too many subdirectories. The cut-off point depends on the length of the URL the PROPFIND request targets.
