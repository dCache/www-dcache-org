### bulk

Correct bulk cancellation semantics.

The problem with cancellation (hanging
perpetually in the CANCELLING state) was solved.

Return directory listing to its own executor.

Same performance as before, but with a total memory
footprint at a little more than half available
physical memory instead of being very close to it.

Add commands to display the count instead of the
actual entry (as with requests and targets), and
also a command to clear/delete from the archive table.

### documentation

Add commands to display the count instead of the
actual entry (as with requests and targets), and
also a command to clear/delete from the archive table.

Fixes link in documentation.

Add section in WebDAV door chapter on metalink.
