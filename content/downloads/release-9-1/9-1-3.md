### dcache-bulk


`prestore` was added as a bulk request option originally in order
to allow immediate retrieval of target paths. When it was then
discovered that lazy storing of the initial paths was not a
workable idea, this option applied only to targets discovered
via recursion.

However, the rationale for storing the entire tree of targets before beginning the processing does not really exist.
The additional semantics, which complicate modifications (should they be desirable), of prestorage are no longer maintained.

### gplazma


gPlazma incompatibiliti detween version before and after 8.2.13 has been detected.

This is now fixed.

### pool


If http client issues two GET requests then zero-copy enabled http mover will try to remove the IdleStateHandler 
twice and fail with NoSuchElementException.

This is now fixed.

### qos

A  bug in storing and retrieving `tried` value for verify operation has been fixed.

### xroot


Modify mkdir to ignore dir exists on make parent option. The result conforms to vanilla xroot server.
