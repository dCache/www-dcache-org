### dcache-bulk


Changes were recently made to hold statistical
counts of requests and targets in memory for
the sake of efficiency. However, running target
counts are still problematic. This is
especially true if a request is cancelled.

This is now fixed and the `running` count, which can be confusing
and inaccurate, is not longer displayed.


RT 10496: Odd errors in Bulk logs for some requests in 9.1.0

This ticket uncovered a bug in the abort procedure.

The stored targets were not cancelled  on abort. this is now fixed.

### dcache-xroot

 Improve efficiency of stat list (`ls -l`) has been introduced.

`ls -l` returns in approximately the
same amount of time as a non-stat listing
`ls`.

### pool

When a hsm provider was dynamically loaded, it doesn't appear in the pools setup file after using save.

this is now fixed and When executing save, hsm load is written to the setup-file.


### xrootd4j

Upgraded to 4.5.8 which improves handling/logging of Ssl exceptions.
