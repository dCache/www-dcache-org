### dchache

By default dcache provides very conservative heap and direct memory sizes, namely 512m. Many sites have adjusted the heap size, but usually keep the direct memory size as-is. 
The recent nfs changes require the direct memory to at least 3% of the heap sizes direct memory shared by xroot mover pools have hard times to serve the data and fail with OOME.

This is now fixed.

### pnfsmanager

List scheduling behavior is now optional.

`pnfsmanager.enable.parallel-listing`  property variable  allows to restore previous behavior - listing requests
 are dispatched to a single queue that is prrocessed by multiple parallel workers.

dCache admin can change behavior of listing scheduler.
