### bulk

Version 2 of the Bulk service was not properly supporting the expectation that the target
paths of a submitted request be immediately visible to the user who issues a GET on the
request. This has now been rectified by storing them in the dedicated database table at
arrival rather than when the request begins to run.

### chimera

A bug was fixed that threw a NullPointerException when the associated hsms for a pool are stored as `null`.

### pool

A bug was fixed that falsely triggered idle connection handler on zero-copy transfers.

### xroot

The default plugins were reordered to conform to ZTN-first.

Proxying through the door has been fixed so that the IP version used by the proxy client
matches what is available on the pools. Before this, proxying through a dual stack door
to pools which were IPv4 only was failing. Note also that billing now reflects the door
IP as the client of the billing transfer, but maintains the originating IP as the client
of the door transaction.

Update xrootd4j to support kXR_prefname in kXR_locate request.
