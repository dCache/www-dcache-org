### bulk

No more uncaught JSON object key not found exception.

### dcache

Application of restrictions is correct in that the ownership
and scope of the resolved link is examined.

### frontend

Add description to Stage, but also to the generic Bulk request
TAPE REST API in the swagger page.

### gplazma

It is now possible to configure dCache so the oidc plugin does not check
audience fields.  This should be used where necessary and only for a
short transition period.

An OP declaration now supports the `-suppress=offline` argument to force
dCache to query the userinfo endpoint, even if the access token is a
JWT.  A warning is logged on startup if offline verification is
suppressed.

### pom

Update stable branches to include bug fix to the TPC client behavior
so that it establishes a secure connection to its source when the source TLS
setting is STRICT.
