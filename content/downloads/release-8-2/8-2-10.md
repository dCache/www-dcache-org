### bulk

Links are handled as they should be when they are refetched from prestored targets and
the requests complete.

Expanded directories are now marked as SKIPPED if activity does not apply 
to directories.

### chimera

When receiving a reply from a pool it is no longer waiting for, cleaner-hsm will not send a new delete request 
or forget the currently-waited-on pool anymore. Logging is added to inform when cleaner-hsm receives 
a reply from a pool it is no longer waiting for, indicating that the timeout might be too small.

### pool

Updated host certificate is available to https mover. Fixed p2p transfers over HTTPS.

### skel

Add the necessary deprecations to
bulk.properties and qos.properties.

### xroot

There should be no longer exceptions reporting no exception handler to handle
the exception.
