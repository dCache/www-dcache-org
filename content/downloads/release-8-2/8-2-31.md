### logback

Redundant replications of unused log files are removed and the qos activity is now recorded as well.

### qos

A bug was fixed that let to the message queue being blocked.

### webdav

This patch speeds up listing of directories through webdav.
All attributes are no longer supported/returned from PROPFIND, unless you set the following property on the WebDav door:

```
#  --- Default PROPFIND properties
#
#  The PROPFIND request allows a client to discover information
#  (properties) of dCache content.  When making a PROPFIND request,
#  the client normally indicates which properties are of interest.  If
#  not specified then the WebDAV server (dCache) is free to return a
#  default set of information.
#
#  Certain clients make PROPFIND requests without specifying
#  the desired set of properties, triggering a default set of
#  properties.  There are two problems with this: first, the
#  clients may react badly if information is missing from this default;
#  second, some of the required properties may have an adverse
#  performance impact for dCache.
#
#  This property controls whether to support client-side requests for
#  properties beyond a minimal set or not.
#
#      PERFORMANCE -- always return only a minimal set of information that does
#                     not incur any additional overhead. (These are basically
#                     the same as what a POSIX list request would proviode).
#
#      CLIENT_COMPATIBLE -- return the set of information required by
#                     the clients.  If the client does not specify the properties,
#                     it will get a maximal default set.
#
#  Because the performance impact of the latter under the most common usage scenarios
#  could be considerable, the default is set to PERFORMANCE.
#
(one-of?PERFORMANCE|CLIENT_COMPATIBLE)webdav.default-propfind-properties = PERFORMANCE
```
