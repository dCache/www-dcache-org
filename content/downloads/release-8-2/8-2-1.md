### Changes affecting multiple services

The commands psu match and psux match can now be used with pnfsid or path.

### core

ac_psu(x)_match commands has been improved to handle null/globbed values correctly in psu match.

### frontend

It is now possible to filter and sort the results of the RESTful API call GET /restores by path, owner and group.

NOTE: This resource is protected by the frontend.authz.unlimited-operation-visibility property, which means that
proprietary information can be optionally protected by limiting it to those with admin privileges.

### gplazma2-grid

An empty requires field in IGTF policy is now accepted. Files with invalid or unexpected policies are ignored.

### webdav

A bug was fixed that caused a NullPointerException while sending Kafka messages.

jquery was updated to version 3.6.1 and bootstrap was updated to version 5.2.1

### xroot

The proxy is now bind to a local address that respects the network of the client and is likely reachable by it.
