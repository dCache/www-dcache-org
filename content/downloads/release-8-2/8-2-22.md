### bulk

Increase the database column `path` to 1024 chars, so ATLAS and others will
not experience failures because paths are too long.

### dcache

Symlinks on both constraints and targets are permitted; thus macaroons
will also work.

### gplazma

If there is a login failure involving a OIDC JWT then potentially
important information is now extracted from the JWT and included
in the logged login failure report.

POSC works with tokens when user root is '/'.

### kafka

Change the LoggingProducerListener so that when a TimeoutException is
caught, the error message will indicate that there is a connection
issue or the broker is down.

### nfs

When on LAYOUTGET door returned an error back to the client, then,
as the operation failed, the client will not issue LAYOUT_RETURN.
Thus such transfers would stay in the door. This is now fixed.
