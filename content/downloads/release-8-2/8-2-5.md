### bulk

The  garbled request policy command output is fixed now


There was a wrong option for target type (REGULAR, not FILE).
This is now fixed and admin commands are now consistent.

### nearline-storage

A NPE on error path has been fixed.

The  race condition  when  flushing removed file is fixed now.

### poolmanager

Motivation:
When a new entry is added to the RequestContainer the file pnfsid and netunit is used as an unique identity. However, despite the fact that
two different units are a members of the same unit group, we might get
two requests created, thus two stages are triggered. For instance:

`0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 & ::/0 => world-net`

`00007BBC36AB359E47A383A75CFA2AB6CDEF@0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0-/ m=1 r=1339 [pool_A] [Waiting for stage: pool_A 10.05 16:41:55] {0,}`
`00007BBC36AB359E47A383A75CFA2AB6CDEF@::/0 m=1 r=1339 [pool_B] [Waiting for stage: pool_B 10.05 16:43:23] {0,}`

now it should work with:

`00007BBC36AB359E47A383A75CFA2AB6CDEF@world-net-/ m=1 r=1339 [pool_A] [Waiting for stage: pool_A 10.05 17:11:37] {0,}`
