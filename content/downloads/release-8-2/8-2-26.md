### frontend

All of the REST GET methods now allow anonymous
users to get the data if the global property
allows it. In the case of NONE, 401 not authorized
is returned at login.

### nfs

A race condition was fixed that let to sending a READ request to a pool when the mover was alreay stopped.

### qos

The behaviour was changed to not scan all pools on startup or periodic rescanning of all pools outside
the periodic window.

A bug was fixed that prevented the bulk request to complete.

The error reporting of aborted verification was improved to get a better understanding, what went wrong.

### xrootd

A missing vomsdir is now throwing an exception instead of a stacktrace.

### xrootd4j

Update xrootd4j to a new version, that fixes a byte buffer leak in ZTNCredentialUtils.
