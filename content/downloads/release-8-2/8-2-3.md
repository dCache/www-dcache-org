### bulk

The command `\s bulk request submit -activity=STAGE` now overrides the -prestore
option to true. This makes it consistent with the RESTful API.

Cancellation of PIN requests via bulk module which were not
marked with -prestore=true no longer fail to complete.

### chimera

Pools that are no longer actively being cleaned were previously falsely
still listed as active in the admin interface when the cleaning attempt
ended due to an exception. This has been fixed.

### core

If a pin is unpinned while a pin request for that same pin is still
ongoing in pinmanager, pinning will not be retried.

### pnfsmanager

On massive uploads (create entries) to a single directory we observed
performance degradation leading to all available threads being busy,
denying other users from accessing the namespace. This has been alleviated.

### pool

The performance of downloading over plain http is increased by using zero-copy mode.

Less CPU load on pools in case of client accessing a file with
invalid/expired state id.

### xroot

A warning was added to the documentation about the default TLS option,
which changed. `OFF` is the only option for TLS which does not
require the presence of the host cert/key.
