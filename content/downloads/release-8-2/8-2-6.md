### bulk

The bulk service now only locks at the beginning until the namespace has been successfully pinged.
All reloading of previous tasks takes place under the covers. Note that the manager still starts
only after the reloading activity has completed. Incoming requests will of course be deprioritized
as their timestamps are posterior to the reloaded requests.

A bug was fixed that prevented an update of counts reported by info().

Improvements were made to significantly speed-up retrieval of target rows if the table grows to more than 100M.

### bulk,frontend

A bug was fixed that prevented cancel on a QUEUED request to move the request from CANCELLING to CANCELLED state.
If a BulkRequest contains an empty target list it will now complete and return a 400 BadRequest.

### chimera

Cleaner cells that do not have leadership will now more strictly enforce not triggering delete runs.

### frontend

Bulk resource target now supports both string and array/list definitions.

### nfs-proxy

Proxy-IO with posix locks now works as expected.

### xroot

xrdcp --cksum now works again.
