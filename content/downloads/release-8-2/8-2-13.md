### common

Prevent two potential NPEs in common utility methods.

IndexOutOfBoundsException should not occur during timeseries histogram
creation; stack trace is replaced by a logging statement.

### gplazma

For xrootd "persist on successful close" (POSC), authorization is
successful for both x509 and OIDC/Scitokens.

### history

The history service should no longer generate the reported
NaN stack trace in the histogram pipeline.
